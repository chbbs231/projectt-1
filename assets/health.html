              <h3>What to eat before, during and after a workout</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Scientists have long known that what you eat before, during and after you exercise can make or break a workout and possibly affect your fitness results.

              So what do nutritionists recommend to munch on? It turns out that quality carbohydrates are important pre-workout and lean proteins post-workout, experts say. Before you exercise, eat carbs, but not too much, said Nancy Cohen, a professor in the department of nutrition at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.
              She recommended consuming 1 to 4 grams of carbohydrates per every 2.2 pounds of body weight if you are planning to exercise for longer than an hour. To put that in perspective, a medium banana has about 27 grams of total carbohydrates.
              The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that if you get 2,000 calories a day, aim to consume between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates, according to the Mayo Clinic.
              When should you eat? About an hour to four hours before working out, Cohen said.
              A review paper by researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia suggests that carbohydrate ingestion can improve endurance exercise performance. The paper was published in the Journal of Nutrition in 2011.
             The researchers assessed 50 previous single- or double-blind, randomized studies on carbohydrate ingestion and endurance exercise. The researchers concluded that the data in the studies provide
             evidence that consuming carbohydrates can enhance</p>

            <p class="card-text">On Tuesday, the Florida Department of Health posted an updated case count to include one death. On Wednesday, the Georgia Department of Public Health also reported one death.
              These two deaths bring the total number nationwide to 11.
              The person in Georgia had a history of "heavy nicotine vaping," but did not report a history of vaping other substances, such as THC, the Georgia Department of Public Health announced on Wednesday. 
              So far the state has identified nine cases of vaping-related illness, including this death, and other possible
              cases are being reviewed.The United States is currently facing a multi-state outbreak of lung injury 
              associated with vaping, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Nine other deaths have been identified as part of this outbreak -- two in California, two in Kansas, and one each in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri and Oregon.
              As of last week, at least 530 cases of lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarettes or vaping products have been reported to the CDC.
              New cases are being confirmed daily and the CDC expects the number of vaping-related illnesses reported this week to be "hundreds higher" than last week, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, 
              principal deputy director of the CDC, during a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Wednesday.hearing on Wednesday.</p>

            <h3>Here's how to protect yourself (and your pets) from EEE, the deadly mosquito-borne virus</h3>
            <p class="card-text">A 10th person has died from Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a rare mosquito-borne illness.

                It's the fourth Massachusetts resident to die from EEE, which can cause brain swelling, in 2019. Previous deaths occurred in Connecticut, Michigan and Rhode Island.
                This year's EEE outbreak has been particularly severe, with 27 human cases of the virus in six states since August.
                Several animals, mostly horses and goats, have gotten the virus, too. A Mexican gray wolf pup died at a Michigan zoo last week after an EEE diagnosis, though officials said it was rare for canines to contract the illness.
                If local health officials have issued EEE warnings for your county, don't panic. Here's how to keep your family, including its furrier members, safe from the virus.
                Go heavy on the repellent
                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends EPA-approved mosquito repellents, particularly those that contain DEET, a powerful active ingredient in many repellents, or the oil of lemon eucalyptus.
                Luckily, it's quite rare for domestic animals like cats and dogs to be diagnosed with EEE (it's named for its prevalence in horses, after all). It's still possible though, so ask your veterinarian for a repellent approved for animal use.
                Unless you have a stable of horses, you can't get an EEE vaccine. The only EEE shot is made exclusively for equines.
                Stay indoors between dusk and dawn

            <h3>Women are dying unnecessarily from heart attacks, leading health charity says</h3>
            
            <p class="card-text">wo women a day are dying unnecessarily from heart attacks in England and Wales because of a gender gap in awareness, diagnosis and treatment, a leading health charity says.

                The British Heart Foundation (BHF) released research on Monday that estimates that more than 8,200 women died between 2003 and 2013 as a result of receiving worse treatment than men.
                The charity wants to end the misconception that heart attacks are a male disease and to encourage women
                 to know the risks and symptoms -- twice as many women in the UK die of coronary heart disease than of 
                 breast cancer. As well as being more likely to receive substandard treatment, women suffer 50% higher rates of misdiagnosis and poorer aftercare, the BHF said -- greatly increasing the risk of death.
                 Additionally, certain risk factors can be more dangerous for women. One of the studies suggests that smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes increase the likelihood of heart attacks more in women than in men.
                 A global review has also shown that women are, on the whole, slower to seek medical help than men. The time between symptoms first appearing and arrival at hospital varies from 1 hour 24 minutes to 3 hours 30 minutes for men. 
                 For women, it was between 1 hour 48 minutes and 7 hours 12 minutes. Myths about "female" heart attack symptoms persist.</p>

            <p class="card-text">You're running on the treadmill, hitting up every HIIT class on your gym's schedule, 
              and strength training more than you ever thought possible. But your scale hasn't gotten the memo. What gives? 
              This five-question quiz will help you pinpoint your problem — and get your weight moving in the right 
              direction. To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you're taking in. (Need proof? Here are six reasons you can't out-exercise a bad diet.) But there's cutting calories and then there's cutting too many calories, says registered dietitian and strength coach Marie Spano, RD, CSSD, CSCS. When you start slashing calories like a ninja, you might not be giving yourself enough fuel to really hit it during your workouts. "You just go through the motions," she says. Plus, many people who start off their days severely restricting calories end up throwing caloric caution to the wind by dinnertime. "If you don't have enough food, you're likely to encounter sugar cravings later in the day," says Washington

            <h3>How much sex should you be having?</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Are you having enough sex? You might have wondered if you should up your bedroom activity after reading about other couples' resolutions to have sex every day or about all the health benefits of getting horizontal.
                In what might be welcome news for everyone exhausted from work and frazzled from kids, research 
                suggests you don't have to get down every day to reap the rewards of sex, at least in terms of 
                happiness and relationship. A recent study found that, although married people or people in committed relationships who had more sex tended to report feeling happier, the benefit leveled off at a sexual frequency of once a week. Those who said they did the deed four or more times a week did not report 
                feeling any happier than those who had trysts only weekly. "I do think couples can end up feeling pressure to try to engage in sex as frequently as possible," said Amy Muise, a postdoctoral researcher studying sexual relationships at Dalhousie University in Canada. Once a week "is maybe a more realistic goal to set than thinking you have to have sex everyday and that feels overwhelming and you avoid it," said Muise.</p>

              <h3>Is coffee healthy?</h3>
              <p class="card-text">Yes, go ahead and grab that cup of joe, or two, or more. Doing so may improve your health and help you live longer, suggests new research.

                  In an observational study involving close to 20,000 individuals, people who consumed at least
                   four cups of coffee daily had a 64% lower risk of early death.The reduction in risk was more significant once people reached the age of 45, suggesting that it may be even more beneficial to consume coffee as we get older.
                   These findings echo the recent results of another large observational study,
                    which found that coffee drinkers appear to live longer, regardless of whether they consume regular or decaf coffee.
                    Coffee has also been shown to reduce the risk of many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, liver disease, colorectal cancer, Alzheimer's and skin cancer, too.
                    "Coffee is loaded with antioxidants," said Joe DeRupo, a spokesman for the National Coffee Association "Many are naturally occurring antioxidants found in the coffee bean, while others are created during the roasting process. It's these compounds that science links with positive 
                    effects in reducing the risk of several diseases.".</p>

                <p class="card-text">This winter, there's a good chance you might be looking for anything and everything to rid yourself of an annoying, lingering and sometimes debilitating cold.

                    You may want to add yogurt to your list of cold-fighting remedies.
                    "When it comes to yogurt specifically, I'd say there's not a lot of research that we can point to that indicates yogurt reduces symptoms of a cold," said Mickey Rubin, vice president of nutrition research for the National Dairy Council. That being said, 
                    "There are some things (in yogurt) we can point to that, in theory, would be beneficial." For example, yogurt is full of probiotics, which can help boost the immune system, according to Kristi L. King, a senior registered dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital and a national spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
                    Studies that have looked at probiotics have found promising results in terms of reducing the duration 
                    and incidence of colds. However, specific benefits can only be attributed to the actual strains studied --
